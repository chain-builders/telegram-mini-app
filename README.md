write a standard roboust read on my telegram/whatsapp miniapp Kirapod: 
- the application has two UI(apps) telegram and whatapp BUT the same contract address. so I consider the two plaform as as one project!
- the reason its like that is because whatsapp doesn't support miniapps but telegram does
- the application on whatsapp is an extremly fast and interactive AI powered chatbot
- the telegram application is an extremly fast and user friendly miniapp. 
- All contracts in the project are deployed on Base
-
